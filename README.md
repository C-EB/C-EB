### 🧾 About Me

I’m not trying to change the world.  
I’m just learning things, building stuff, and sharing it here.

GitHub is where I document what I’m doing — whether it’s web scraping, automating something, writing scripts, or testing out tech I find interesting.  
No fancy titles. No big talk. Just code, curiosity, and progress.

---

### 🧰 What You'll Find Here

- Web scraping with `Selenium`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Requests`  
- Scripts and tools I build to practice or solve personal needs  
- Projects that reflect real learning — trial, error, and growth  
- Clean code (or messy code I'm working on cleaning)

---

### 🧭 What I’m Currently Exploring

- Python scripting and automation  
- APIs and data pipelines  
- Web automation and dynamic scraping  
- Anything that seems interesting enough to try

### 🔑 Personal Rule

> “Do the work. Push the code. That’s it.”
