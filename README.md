### 🧾 About Me

Not trying to solve any problem by coding.  
Just learning things, building stuff, and sharing it here.

GitHub is where I document what I’m doing — whether it’s web scraping, automation, scripting, or exploring random tech.  
No titles. No hype. Just curiosity, code, and growth in progress.

---

### 🧰 What You'll Find Here

- Web scraping with `Selenium`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `Requests`  
- Python scripts and automation tools I build for myself  
- Projects that show what I’m learning and experimenting with  
- A mix of clean code and messy drafts (that I sometimes clean up)

---

### 🧭 What I’m Currently Exploring

- Python scripting  
- APIs and data handling  
- Web automation  
- Whatever catches my interest next
