### 🧭 About Me

I'm not a data analyst. Not a web developer. Not a software engineer — **yet**.  
But I am:

- 🧠 A curious mind that never stops learning  
- 🔧 A builder who turns ideas into working code  
- 🎯 A realist documenting my journey in public  
- 💻 A passionate self-learner using GitHub as my portfolio

I don't have a title.  
But I have code. Projects. Proof of work.  
This is where I show what I'm capable of — not through resumes, but through repositories.
