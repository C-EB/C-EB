# 👋 Hi, I'm Charif

I'm a self-taught tech enthusiast from Morocco, constantly exploring and experimenting across different areas in the world of technology.

I use GitHub as a space to document and showcase my learning journey — from data scraping and automation to scripting, web technologies, and beyond. While I don’t hold a formal title like “Data Scientist” or “Web Developer,” what I do have is curiosity, consistency, and a growing portfolio of real hands-on projects.

### 🚀 What you’ll find in my GitHub:
- 🕸️ Web scraping with Python (Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Requests)
- 🛠️ Automation tools and scripts
- 📊 Data exploration & manipulation (Pandas, JSON, APIs)
- 🌐 Experiments with web technologies
- 🧪 Projects that reflect my learning journey, trial and error, and growth

---

💬 Always learning, always building.

Feel free to check out my repos and see how I’m growing through code.
